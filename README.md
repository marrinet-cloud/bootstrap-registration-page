This project was to build a webpage containing a registration form using bootstrap concepts covered in the lesson. My webpage is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes, with a now you see me,
now you dont button. the other button is just random and always displayed, I figured I could add some fun to it so i made it kind of explode when clicked. At the top of the webpage is a navigation bar with
the title of the page, home, about, and contact that have added hover effects. The navigation bar condenses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens. My webpage also includes a large picture that spreads across
the entire page and another smaller circle image. they both are just random pictures upon page refresh. A registration form is the star of page. It includes entries for first and last names, email and passwords.
As well as a check box to agree to terms and conditions. To submit the form you must complete the required fields or an error will display. At the bottom of the page is a table that displays simulated registered users.
The information is hard coded in a doesnt change. Using bootstrap for me was a little confusing at first , but I focused on building one element at a time and referred to the lesson to answer questions I had. I think
I have built a nice looking and professional webpage that is responsive  I hope you like it.
